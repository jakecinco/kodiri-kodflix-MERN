			description: `A family get trapped when a landslide is caused by a tidal wave.`,
			review: `Nestled in Norway's Sunnmøre region, Geiranger is one of the 
			most spectacular tourist draws on the planet. With the mountain Åkerneset overlooking the village 
			- and constantly threatening to collapse into the fjord - it is also a place where cataclysm could 
			strike at any moment. After putting in several years at Geiranger's warning center, 
			geologist Kristian is moving on to a prestigious gig with an oil company. But the very day he's 
			about to drive his family to their new life in the city, Kristian senses something isn't right. 
			The substrata are shifting. No one wants to believe that this could be the big one ... `

			description: `Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing, they now have to prepare for the hunt,
but what (or who) is the prey?`,
			country: 'Norway',
			review: `"The Hunt" begins with Lucas leading a contented (though not exactly perfect) life 
			in a small town. A teacher by training, he has been left jobless by the closing of the local school; 
			now he works in a daycare, looking after kids during the day and drinking with their parents in the 
			evening. Everything changes, however, when — in a moment of anger — one of Lucas' charges tells 
			the daycare owner he sexually abused her.  
			From there, the accusation snowballs.`

			name: 'the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo',
			description: `What happens when a journalist, computer hacker and
		sadist's fates are entagled with each other?`,
			country: 'Sweden',
			review: `A compelling thriller to begin with, but it adds the rare quality of having a heroine 
			more fascinating than the story. She's a 24-year-old goth girl named Lisbeth Salander,
			 with body piercings and tattoos: thin, small, fierce, damaged, a genius computer hacker. 
			 She smokes to quiet her racing heart. Lisbeth is as compelling as any movie character 
			 in recent memory. Played by Noomi Rapace with an unwavering intensity, 
			 she finds her own emotional needs nurtured by the nature of the case she investigates, 
			 the disappearance of a young girl 40 years earlier. 
			 As this case is revealed as part of a long-hidden pattern of bizarre violence against women, 
			 memories of her own abused past return with a vengeance.`

			while living a double life mingling with Stockholm's wealthy elite. To keep up the façade of

			the police and Serbian mafia. He hopes that brokering a massive cocaine deal will allow

			As JW's journey ventures deeper into the dark world of organized crime,

			id: 'trapped-film',
			name: 'trapped',
			description: `A multilated corpse is found by a fisherman, who does the headless, limbless
		body belong to?`,
			country: 'Iceland',
			review: `You have to feel for poor Andri in “Trapped”, even before everything goes wrong. 
			He’s the police chief of Seyðisfjörður, a bleak little place at the end of a fjord in the east 
			of Iceland.Andri’s work isn’t so interesting: crimes against parking are about as exciting as 
			it gets. Nor is home life much sunnier. No wonder Andri’s a bit grumpy. And then it all happens. 
			A body is fished out of the fjord;  there are no limbs, no head - just a torso. 
			Andri thinks the torso may have come off the weekly ferry that has just arrived. 
			There’s a Lithuanian people-trafficker on board with his sickening cargo. Hjörtur, the town’s 
			prodigal son, who is still suspected of starting the fire at the town’s fish factory in which his 
			girlfriend died, is also back, and almost certainly up to no good. Then the weather closes in – 
			a proper meteorological event, a blizzard. Seyðisfjörður is cut off, no help can get in and 
			there’s a murderer on the loose. And the torso’s gone! Things have snowballed into a frozen hell for poor 
			Andri – but it makes a brilliant scenario for a moody crime drama.`

			id: 'dicte-tv-series',
			name: 'dicte',
			description: `A divorced journalist goes back to her home town to make peace with her past, but
		things take an ugly turn`,
			country: 'Denmark',
			review: `The series is named for the title character, Dicte Svendsen, played by Iben Hjejle. 
			Dicte is a crime reporter who goes back to her hometown of Aarhus after a divorce.  
			The show follows the tradition of other successful Danish series with well-written female leads and 
			Dicte’s definitely a well-written character. She has a troubled history that colors her behavior at work 
			and her personal life. She works closely with the police, but often leaps to wrong conclusions based on her 
			own background. She’s an excellent investigator and often is instrumental in helping solve crimes.`
